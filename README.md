# Data-Science-Capstone-Project-Coursera-
This project, using data gotten from SpaceX and Wikipedia aims to determine if a rocket will land successfully. 

## Project background and context
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. This goal of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land successfully.

## Problems you want to find answers
What factors determine if the rocket will land successfully?
The interaction amongst various features that determine the success rate of a successful landing.
What operating conditions needs to be in place to ensure a successful landing program.
